# Limpiosity website
You can see the live version of this web [here](http://limpiosity.qubic.es).

It has been built using:
+ [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) with [webapp generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) to scaffold the web structure. It includes [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to automate repetitive tasks.
+ [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) with scss syntax for the styles.
+ [Font-awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for most icons.
+ [Reveal effects](https://scrollrevealjs.org) for scroll animations.
+ [Better simple slideshow](http://leemark.github.io/better-simple-slideshow/) for the gallery alongside with [hammerjs](http://hammerjs.github.io) for swiping on touch capable devices.
* [Google maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/?hl=es) for the map and [Google fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) for, well, it is obvious.

The main purpose of this website is showing off the robot project as well as learning web development through the whole process.
